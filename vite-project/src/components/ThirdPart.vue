        <h3>Letâ€™s come back to our two distinct visions of the evolution of robotics. We have those who think robots will replace us at work and those who think robotics will create jobs. Both are true because by creating robots we create jobs but eventually these built robots will be used to replace man in various tasks. And precisely, it is interesting to wonder about the types of jobs that could be threatened by robotics. Although employees may be replaced by robots, this situation does not apply to all jobs. If we take the example in the next document, there is a list of the types of jobs that could be automated or not. What is clear from this document is that the sector most affected by automation is mainly manual, creative trades, often from factory to factory. These are the first jobs that are likely to be replaced with the appearance of machines capable of reproducing more precise movements, at a regular and rapid rate and all for hours, days, months, years. With the advantage of not feeling fatigue, these machines are a huge progress for product creation, assembly etc, but remain an enemy for all industrial workers. Of course, automated trades are not just manual trades. The current developments in robotics are not only aimed at performing automated tasks, but also at autonomous decision-making and even robot-human collaboration. In the coming years, more and more intellectual tasks will be taken on by digital tools. Next-generation robots could handle 25% of automated tasks by 2025, compared to only 10% currently for traditional robots, according to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. This automation of jobs would destroy nearly 3 million jobs in France by 2025, and would have a major impact on the services sector, which was previously spared. On the other hand, jobs that require cognitive input and reflection have very little exposure to automation. That being said, it is clear that in this case thousands or even millions of people are at risk of losing their jobs as a result of this automation.</h3>
