        <h3>Hospitals also have increasingly efficient machines that allow staff to delegate certain tasks in order to optimize working time and ensure better care for patients. Among these new innovative and efficient machines we have 2 very interesting examples. Here is the TUG robot, an autonomous mobile robot specially designed for hospitals. It uses a built-in map and sensors to navigate hospital lobbies and communicates with elevators, fire alarms and automatic doors via Wi-Fi. When they are not at work, the robots go back to the individual charging stations on their own to recharge before the next race. They are also very user-friendly, with simple buttons «start», «stop» and «lift» and a touch screen that displays their next deposit or support mission. For secure shipments such as medicines and samples, hospital staff will open and close the TUG secure compartment via fingerprint identification. In itself, the aim here is not to make a journey quickly but rather to create a better use of time. The TUG allows hospital staff to spend more time with patients and make trips to bring food or equipment, while reducing staff actions for this type of handling.</h3>

        <h3>Still in the field of health and medicine, we are constantly evolving to create new ways of being effective in the provision of care and thus to create machines of increasing performance to support us. I was able to discover, by doing my research, a semi-robotic tool recently created (2017) that made it possible to revolutionize the medical industry. By developing techniques and providing training in the use of robots in minimally invasive surgeries, the project is improving the quality of surgical procedures, reducing patient recovery times and opening the door to tomorrow’s innovative medicine. The Da Vinci Surgery System project, with its high definition 3D vision system and these more “flexible” articulated tools, enables complex surgical operations to be performed with a precision that the human hand will never be able to match. Patients benefit from less aggressive interventions and a faster path to recovery.
        This is a considerable step forward for our society and it allows us to relaunch the in-depth research of increasingly advanced technologies to help us on a daily basis, but not only in the field of health.
