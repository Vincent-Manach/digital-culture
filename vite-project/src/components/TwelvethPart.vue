    <h3>But if we look more deeply into the case of these AI we must nevertheless note that these programs learn by themselves as they analyze and create. Creating and creating en masse makes it possible to improve their system of recognition and therefore of creation to become more and more perfomant and to create deepfakes more and more real and indetectable. But is it likely that one day AI in general will overtake us?</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Indeed, we like to create new things and always go above and beyond to meet real needs in our society. As long as it is possible for us to do so, why will we stop? What could stop us? 
    At some point we will create machines that are smarter than we are and they will eventually improve on their own. The slightest divergence between our goals and theirs can destroy us. We destroy unscrupulous machines so why wouldnâ€™t they treat us the same one day?  
    We will continue to improve the intelligence of our machines, we will do it because we want to, cure alzeihmer or cancers, understand the economic system, improve climate science, etc.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The spectrum of intelligence is much greater than we think, and if we build smarter machines than we are, they will explore that spectrum much further than we can imagine 
    What could happen to our economy and our politics if the machines were so intelligent and functional that they would do our daily tasks and our work in our place while we are 100% free to do whatever we want. The spectrum of intelligence is much greater than we think, and if we build smarter machines than we are, they will explore that spectrum much further than we can imagine. What could happen to our economy and our politics if the machines were so intelligent and functional that they would do our daily tasks and our work in our place while we are 100% free to do whatever we want. We will face a wave of unemployment where the wealthiest are safe.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>If we continue to improve our machines we will one day create one or more forms of super AI but we do not know how long it will take us to do it safely. If we admit that we are constantly improving our machines so that they can exceed the knowledge we have, we must admit that we are building a kind of god, and then we need to make sure that we can live safely and properly with him.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>In conclusion, I would say that we must not be afraid of this, but rather we must seek to use robotics wisely, because it is an important part of our work. What is also important is to question the way robots of all kinds are produced and the fact that the population is set aside without being able to give their opinion on them.</h3>
