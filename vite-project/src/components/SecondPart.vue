        <h3>First we have to ask ourselves if the AI is a good thing for our society regarding the employment because employment and unemployment are directly impacted by the evolution of the AI over the years. Indeed, to develop and build beautiful machines we need lot of people to think how to build it, to think what the machine gonna do, i mean its purpose, and finally to build it for real.</h3>
        <h3>But the creation of new robots that are increasingly efficient and that could replace the human being in several tasks preoccupied the society. So we can discern 2 types of vision about the impact of the evolution of the robotization on the employment. In one hand there are those who affirm that robotics gonna contribute to the creation of several jobs and in the other hand, those who persuaded that robots gonna replace the job of industries workers and managerial staff to the point of having to consider a new method to apprehend the work. These 2 visions, although different, each present a certain truth. We are aware that the robotization gonna lead us to more advanced technologies that will make our lives easier but at what cost ?</h3>

        <h3>It can be deduced from this graph that the growth of the robotics market is only increasing over the years and that it will remain in this increase for the following years. In addition, this makes it possible to affirm that the producers of new machines have the means necessary for their achievements. Although the field of robotics is experiencing an increase in its market, it is not necessarily so for everyone. Or at least, some countries stand out, as can be seen from this graph representing the number of robots per 10,000 employees in the industry in 2014. It is very clear that Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan are well ahead while Germany remains on the podium with a good lead over the other countries. This graph gives us an idea of the industrial robotic density of a country, which aims to know the average degree of robotics of this one. This is obtained by calculating the number of robots per 10,000 employees in industry.</h3>

        <h3>So what is the impact of robotics on employment? How does it influence the labour market?</h3>
