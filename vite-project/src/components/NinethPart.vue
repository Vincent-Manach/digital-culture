        <h3>Although man is capable of creating formidable machines that revolutionize our society, which enable us to improve our living conditions (through the creation of new jobs, the creation of machines in the field of health capable of helping people in difficulties such as social robots, able to assist hospital staff in delegating certain tasks so that they can use more of their time for patients, able to assist the staff in very detailed operations thanks to advanced and innovative technology allowing more precise and efficient actions or with the robots recently created in agriculture allowing a better management of the harvests and therefore a more efficient yield with a response to the needs of the different varieties more autonomous and specific). Although man can create this kind of technology that has an unparalleled advantage in our society, there is a negative part of the evolution of robotics and AI that can inspire a certain distrust, a fear, even fear. Of course we have advanced technologies to facilitate our lives but there are programs and creations around us that can be misused and impact the daily life of the population or some like the superintelligence that could one day overtake us. </h3><br>
        <h3>Indeed, with the evolution of our technologies and the power of AI, the spectrum of AI actions is growing to the point of creating programs that can be malicious. I am thinking in particular of deepfakes which are becoming more and more present and which can manipulate data, images, videos in order to deceive us, to realize something false but which seems true. 
        Deepfake is a multimedia synthesis technique based on artificial intelligence. It can be used to overlay existing audio or video files on other video files (for example, changing a person’s face on a video) or audio files (for example, reproducing a person’s voice to make them say invented things). This technique can be used to create malicious infox and hoaxes. The term deepfake is a suitcase word formed from deep learning and fake. But when was the creation of these deepfakes? 
        Techniques to simulate facial movements and transpose them to a target person were presented in 2016. They made it possible to counterfeit facial expressions in videos in near real time. Audio hypertrucage appeared in November 2016, with the presentation of the program, Adobe Voco, the first audio hypertrucage program capable of reproducing the human voice.
        In July 2017, the BBC broadcasted a speech delivered by an artificial intelligence reproducing Obama, speech essentially indistinguishable from reality.
