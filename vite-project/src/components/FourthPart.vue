        <h3>But what about the creation of jobs linked to robotics? Because although some employees may no longer have work because of machines that will replace them, these machines must still be created and this thus makes it possible to create jobs. If we look at the following document, we can conclude that the elimination of various jobs also gives rise to others. If we look at the figures more closely, the highest estimate of the number of jobs created by robotics in the world was more than 1,500,000 jobs created between 2012 and 2016 and more than 2 million between 2017 and 2020. As robotics evolves, we are able to create many more jobs and thus influence the unemployment rate in our countries. If the estimates are correct and more than 2 million jobs are created in exchange for those lost, we could provide work for those whose jobs have been automated but also for those who are unemployed. We can also see in the following document that the evolution of robotics within a country is not necessarily a negative factor on jobs and unemployment. Indeed, if we take the case of Germany, which increased its number of robots enormously during the period 2000 - 2010, the unemployment rate, after having increased over several years over the evolution of robotics, has declined significantly and has been in continuous decline for several years. We find similar effects in Brazil and South Korea where the unemployment rate decreases while the number of robots in the country increases, proof that the evolution of robotics and the number of robots in a country is not necessarily significant of a decrease in employment following the automation of certain positions. And so to conclude this part it is important to take into account the fact that even if the evolution of robotics eliminates “human” jobs to let machines take care of certain tasks, This does not in any way mean that robotics are a brake on employment, since they also create jobs and thus create new machines and robots. Moreover, these machines and robots that we create replace certain positions but they can prove useful and of great help in certain sectors of activity.</h3>
