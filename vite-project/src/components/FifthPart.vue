    <h3>Thanks, therefore, to the jobs created by the evolution of robotics, we can create great machines that will become real aids on a daily basis. Indeed for years our company has been creating new machines that are more and more useful and revolutionary. Thanks to these different machines, we can access information much more quickly, for example thanks to the new smartphones with mobile networks that are becoming faster and more efficient and with an Internet network that is becoming more and more controlled. Thanks to these different machines it is now possible for us to automate tasks as we have seen before and thus to increase our quality and speed of production in various fields or to improve the quality of life of the population with new equipment as new speakers connected/home assistant, such as Google Home or Alexa which allow users to ask connected speakers for various tasks they can perform. For example simple tasks that smartphones could perform like playing a song or calling someone. But also more “technological” tasks in connected homes, such as turning on or off a light or closing the shutters, for example, since the domestic assistant interacts with the house. Of course we have to have special light bulbs and shutters but these new machines/features allow us to leave small tasks to our assistant and to do something else at the same time. It is these new machines that allow us to have an increasingly comfortable standard of living. Anyway, we live today with these new technologies that simplify our daily lives. Living with these new technologies has become something common today. It’s true, we are less and less impressed because we create. A few decades ago we created the phone, television or even the computer and at that time it was real revolutions and technological prowess while nowadays we try to create things more and more powerful but which fascinates us or surprises us much less because we are accustomed to the evolution of our technologies. Yet today there are very powerful and innovative machines that make our daily lives easier, but not just ours, as a people, There are also various fields or new machines emerging which allow the worker to be more efficient, especially in medicine and agriculture.</h3>
